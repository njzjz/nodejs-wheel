`nodejs-wheel` is an unofficial repository to distribute Node.js prebuilt wheels through PyPI using 

```sh
pip install nodejs-wheel
```

The package requires Python 3.7 and above.

The project is powered by [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) and [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).

## Other projects

The project is inspired by many other similiar projects:

- [samwillis/nodejs-pypi](https://github.com/samwillis/nodejs-pypi): The package redistribute the official Node.js binaraies to PyPI. However, the offical binary for Nodejs 18 requires GLIBC 2.28, making it unsupported in [manylinux2014](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) images. Besides, the wheel tag is wrong.
- [sbwml/node-latest-centos](https://github.com/sbwml/node-latest-centos): Use GitHub Actions to build Node.js in CentOS 7, but is not related to Python or PyPI.
- [scikit-build/cmake-python-distributions](https://github.com/scikit-build/cmake-python-distributions): Use cibuildwheel and scikit-build to build CMake and distribute CMake in PyPI.
